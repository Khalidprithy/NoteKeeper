<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Welcome to QuickNote, a simple and intuitive note-taking application built with React! With QuickNote, you can easily create, update, and delete notes to keep track of your thoughts, ideas, and tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or just someone who likes to stay organized, QuickNote makes it easy to stay on top of things.

One of the standout features of QuickNote is the ability to "pin" important notes to the top of your list, making them easy to find and access whenever you need them. QuickNote is designed with a clean and modern interface that is easy to use and customizable to your preferences. It can be easily customize to variety of themes and color schemes to make QuickNote look and feel just the way you want it.

Whether you're using QuickNote for personal or professional purposes, we hope it helps you stay productive and organized. Thank you for choosing QuickNote!

# Key Features:

* Add, Update, and Delete Notes: With QuickNote, you can easily add new notes, update existing ones, or delete notes you no longer need. The note-taking process is simple and straightforward, allowing you to focus on capturing your thoughts and ideas.

* Pagination: QuickNote uses pagination to keep six notes per page in a grid layout. This helps keep your notes organized and easy to navigate, even if you have a large number of notes.

* Pin and Unpin Notes: To help you quickly access your most important notes, QuickNote allows you to pin and unpin notes. Pinned notes will appear at the top of your list, making them easy to find and access.

* Deleted Notes Page: If you delete a note, don't worry! QuickNote stores deleted notes on a separate page, allowing you to restore them if needed.

* Pop-up Modal for Adding New Notes: QuickNote uses a pop-up modal to add new notes, making it easy to capture your thoughts without interrupting your workflow. The modal is simple and easy to use, allowing you to quickly add new notes without any distractions.

* Pop-up Modal for Confirmation on Deleting Each Note: To prevent accidental deletions, QuickNote uses a pop-up modal to confirm the deletion of each note. This helps ensure that you don't accidentally delete important notes

* Pop-up Modal for Wiping Out All Deleted Notes: If you want to permanently delete all of your deleted notes, QuickNote uses a pop-up modal to confirm the action. This helps prevent accidental data loss and ensures that you're only deleting notes that you no longer need.

* Automatic Dark Mode: QuickNote features an automatic dark mode that automatically switches to a darker color scheme based on your device's settings. This helps reduce eye strain and makes it easier to use QuickNote in low-light environments.

* Fully Responsive: QuickNote is designed to be fully responsive, meaning that it works well on both large and small devices. Whether you're using QuickNote on your desktop or mobile device, you can expect a smooth and seamless experience.
